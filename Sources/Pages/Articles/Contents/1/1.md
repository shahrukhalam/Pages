# Hello World

Templating languages are the most common way to render HTML in web frameworks, but we don’t think they are the best way. We compare templating languages to the DSL we previously built, and show that the DSL fixes many problems that templates have, while also revealing amazing compositions that were previously hidden.

```swift
var someVar: String = "hello"
    
func blah() -> String {
    var someVar: String = "world"
    return someVar
}
```
